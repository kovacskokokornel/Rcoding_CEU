	echo = TRUE
)
```


## Exercise 1

```{r, include=FALSE}
library('tidyverse')
library(nycflights13)
```

1, The number of flights (in the whole year) to each destination
```{r}
dest_counter <- 
  flights %>%
  group_by(dest) %>%
  summarize(dest_count = n())

top_n(dest_counter, 10)
```

2, The number and list of distinct airports in the US

I think the number of entries should be the same with ``faa`` and ``name`` as well, but they are not. No idea why.
```{r}
dist_airports_acc_to_faa <- distinct(filter(airports, 
                                            grepl('America', tzone)), 
                                     faa)
dist_airports_acc_to_name <- distinct(filter(airports, 
                                             grepl('America', tzone)), 
                                      name)

top_n(dist_airports_acc_to_faa, 10)
top_n(dist_airports_acc_to_name, 10)

nrow(dist_airports_acc_to_faa)
nrow(dist_airports_acc_to_name)
```

3, The number airports that are further south than NYC (Hint: look up longitude and latitude.)

![ ](nyc_lat_long.PNG)

We are only looking for airports to the south, therefore we only need longitude.

```{r}
nyc_lon <- -73.935242
south_from_nyc <- filter(airports, 
                         lon < nyc_lon)
nrow(south_from_nyc)
```

4, The top 5 carriers that have the lowest average delay times.

For further analysis, we should include the number of flights for each carrier.
As it was not defined I worked with arrival delays rather than departure ones as they are more relevant to customers.

```{r}
(airlines_on_time <- flights %>%
  filter(!is.na(arr_delay)) %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(avg_delay = mean(arr_delay), count = n()) %>%
  arrange(avg_delay) %>%
  head(5))

```

## Exercise 2

1, **diamonds** dataset, columns: ``carat``, ``color``

```{r}
(missing_diamonds <- diamonds %>%
  filter(is.na(carat), is.na(color)))
```

2, **flights** dataset, columns: ``arr_delay``, ``dep_delay``

```{r}
(missing_flights <- flights %>%
  filter(is.na(arr_delay), is.na(dep_delay)))
```

3, **mtcars** dataset, columns: ``cyl``, ``mpg``

```{r}
(missing_mtcars <- mtcars %>%
  filter(is.na(cyl), is.na(mpg)))
```

Searching for ``NA`` values in all columns would require to type the name of all the columns of the DF. It requires a lot of time and exposes us to the pain of typos.

## Exercise 3

```{r}
(diamonds_any_missing <- filter_all(diamonds, any_vars(is.na(.))))

(flights_any_missing <- filter_all(flights, any_vars(is.na(.))))

(mtcars_any_missing <- filter_all(mtcars, any_vars(is.na(.))))
```

## Exercise 4 

I picked this one to skip. I know myself; if I had done this exercise, I would have spent 80% of the time choosing my favourite dataset instead of visualisation and it would not have been efficient now.

## Exercise 5

Calculate the average values of ``x`` and ``y`` for each group in the below dataset.

```{r}
(df <- read_csv("1,2,3
         2,-,6
         2,9,-", col_names = c("group_number", "x", "y"),na = "-"))
```

Wrong solution:
```{r}
(avg_df <- df %>%
  group_by(group_number) %>%
  summarise(avg_x = mean(x), avg_y = mean(y)))
```

Good solution: 
```{r}
(avg_df <- df %>%
  filter(!is.na(x), !is.na(y)) %>%
  group_by(group_number) %>%
  summarise(avg_x = mean(x), avg_y = mean(y)))
```

**Take-away:** if a group of values contains at least one ``NA`` value, the average will be ``NA`` as well. R will not disregard them automatically, you have to filter out tha ``NA`` values before calculating means (and probably other summary statistics as well).

## Exercise 6

It is about reading our own data to R. Quite helpful.

Reading own CSV file:

```{r}
hotels <- read.csv(file = "..//da_data_repo/hotelbookingdata.csv")
```

"Reading" CSV inputted from command.

```{r}
read_csv("a,b,c
1,2,3
4,5,6")
```

Skipping rows:

```{r}
read_csv("The first line of metadata
  The second line of metadata
  x,y,z
  1,2,3", skip = 2)
```

Reading without header:

```{r}
read_csv("1,2,3
         4,5,6", col_names = FALSE)
```

Inputting column names separately:

```{r}
read_csv("1,2,3
         4,5,6", col_names = c("x", "y", "z"))
```

We can tell R what input chars to transform to NA values:

```{r}
read_csv("a,b,c
         1,.,.", na = ".")
```
